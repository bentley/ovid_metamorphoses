					<h3 epub:type="title">Pythagorean Philosophy</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">The Pythagorean system of philosophy, which is here minutely described, is adopted and taught by Numa, who is chosen by the Romans to be the successor of Romulus.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>A king is sought to guide the growing state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One able to support the public weight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fill the throne where Romulus had sate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Renown, which oft bespeaks the public voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had recommended Numa to their choice:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A peaceful pious prince; who not content</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To know the Sabine rites, his study bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To cultivate his mind; to learn the laws</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of nature, and explore their hidden cause.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Urged by this care, his country he forsook,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to Crotona thence his journey took.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arrived, he first inquired the founder’s name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this new colony, and whence he came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then thus a senior of the place replies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Well read, and curious of antiquities:)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ’Tis said, Alcides hither took his way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Spain, and drove along his conquer’d prey;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, leaving in the fields his grazing cows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sought himself some hospitable house;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good Croton entertain’d his godlike guest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he repair’d his weary limbs with rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hero, thence departing, bless’d the place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘And here,’ he said, ‘in lime’s revolving race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A rising town shall take his name from thee.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Revolving time fulfill’d the prophecy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Myscelos, the justest man on earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alemon’s son, at Argos had his birth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him Hercules, arm’d with his club of oak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’ershadow’d in a dream, and thus bespoke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Go, leave thy native soil, and make abode</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where Aesaris rolls down his rapid flood.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said; and sleep forsook him, and the god.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trembling he waked, and rose with anxious heart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His country laws forbade him to depart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What should he do? ’twas death to go away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the god menaced if he dared to stay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All day he doubted, and when night came on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleep, and the same forewarning dream, begun:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once more the god stood threatening o’er his head:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With added curses if he disobey’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twice warn’d, he studied flight; but would convey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At once his person and his wealth away:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus while he linger’d his design was heard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A speedy process form’d, and death declared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Witness there needed none of his offence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against himself the wretch was evidence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Condemn’d, and destitute of human aid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him for whom he suffer’d thus he pray’d:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Oh power, who hast deserved in heaven a throne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not given, but by thy labours made thy own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pity thy suppliant, and protect his cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom thou hast made obnoxious to the laws.’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“A custom was of old, and still remains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which life or death by suffrages ordains:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>White stones and black within an urn are cast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first absolve, but fate is in the last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The judges to the common urn bequeath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their votes, and drop the sable signs of death;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The box receives all black, but, pour’d from thence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stones came candid forth the hue of innocence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Alemonides his safety won,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Preserved from death by Alcumena’s son:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to his kinsman god his vows he pays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cuts with prosperous gales the Ionian seas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He leaves Tarentum favour’d by the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Thurine bays, and Temises, behind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soft Sybaris, and all the capes that stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the shore, he makes in sight of land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still doubling, and still coasting, till he found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mouth of Aesaris, and promised ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then saw, where, on the margin of the flood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tomb that held the bones of Croton stood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here, by the gods’ command, he built, and wall’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The place predicted; and Crotona call’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus fame, from time to time, delivers down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sure tradition of the Italian town.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Here dwelt the man divine, whom Samos bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now self-banish’d from his native shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because he hated tyrants, nor could bear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chains, which none but servile souls will wear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He, though from heaven remote, to heaven could move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With strength of mind, and tread the abyss above;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And penetrate, with his interior light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those upper depths which nature hid from sight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what he had observed and learn’d from thence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loved in familiar language to dispense.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The crowd with silent admiration stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heard him as they heard their god’s command;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he discoursed of Heaven’s mysterious laws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world’s original, and nature’s cause;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what was God; and why the fleecy snows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In silence fell, and rattling winds arose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What shook the steadfast earth, and whence begun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dance of planets round the radiant sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thunder was the voice of angry Jove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or clouds with nitre pregnant, burst above;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of these, and things beyond the common reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spoke, and charm’d his audience with his speech.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He first the taste of flesh from tables drove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And argued well, if arguments could move:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Oh mortals, from your fellows’ blood abstain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor taint your bodies with a food profane.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While corn and pulse by nature are bestow’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And planted orchards bend their willing load;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While labour’d gardens wholesome herbs produce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And teeming vines afford their generous juice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor tardier fruits of cruder kind are lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tamed with fire, or mellow’d by the frost;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While kine to pails distended udders bring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bees their honey redolent of spring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While earth not only can your needs supply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But lavish of her store, provides for luxury;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A guiltless feast administers with ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And without blood is prodigal to please.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wild beasts their maws with their slain brethren fill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet not all, for some refuse to kill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sheep, goats, and oxen, and the nobler steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On browse, and corn, and flowery meadows feed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bears, tigers, wolves, the lion’s angry brood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom Heaven indued with principles of blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wisely sunder’d from the rest, to yell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In forests, and in lonely caves to dwell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where stronger beasts oppress the weak by might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all in prey and purple feasts delight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Oh impious use! to nature’s laws opposed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where bowels are in other bowels closed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where fatten’d by their fellows’ fat, they thrive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maintain’d by murder, and by death they live.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis then for naught, that mother earth provides</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stores of all she shows, and all she hides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If men with fleshy morsels must be fed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chew with bloody teeth the breathing bread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What else is this, but to devour our guests,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And barb’rously renew cyclopean feasts!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We, by destroying life, our life sustain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gorge the ungodly maw with meats obscene.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Not so the golden age, who fed on fruit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor durst with bloody meals their mouths pollute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then birds in airy space might safely move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And timorous hares on heaths securely rove:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor needed fish the guileful hooks to fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all was peaceful; and that peace sincere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoever was the wretch (and cursed be he)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That envied first our food’s simplicity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The essay of bloody feasts on brutes began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after forged the sword to murder man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had he the sharpen’d steel alone employ’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On beasts of prey, that other beasts destroy’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or man invaded with their fangs and paws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This had been justified by nature’s laws</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And self-defence: but who did feasts begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of flesh, he stretch’d necessity to sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To kill man-killers man has lawful power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not the extended license to devour.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Ill habits gather by unseen degrees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As brooks make rivers, rivers run to seas.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sow, with her broad snout, for rooting up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The entrusted seed, was judged to spoil the crop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And intercept the sweating farmer’s hope:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The covetous churl, of unforgiving kind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The offender to the bloody priest resign’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her hunger was no plea: for that she died.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The goat came next in order to be tried:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The goat had cropp’d the tendrils of the vine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vengeance laity and clergy join,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where one had lost his profit, one his wine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here was at least some shadow of offence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sheep was sacrificed on no pretence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But meek and unresisting innocence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A patient, useful creature, born to bear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The warm and woolly fleece, that clothed her murderer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And daily to give down the milk she bred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tribute for the grass on which she fed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Living, both food and raiment she supplies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is of least advantage when she dies.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘How did the toiling ox his death deserve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A downright simple drudge, and horn to serve?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh tyrant! with what justice canst thou hope</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The promise of the year, a plenteous crop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thou destroy’st thy labouring steer, who till’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And plough’d with pains, thy else ungrateful field?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From his yet reeking neck, to draw the yoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That neck with which the surly clods he broke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the hatchet yield thy husbandman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who finish’d autumn, and the spring began.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Nor this alone! but Heaven itself to bribe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We to the gods our impious acts ascribe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First recompense with death their creatures’ toil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then call the bless’d above to share the spoil:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fairest victim must the powers appease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(So fatal ’tis sometimes too much to please!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A purple fillet his broad brow adorns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With flowery garlands crown’d, and gilded horns:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hears the murderous prayer the priest prefers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But understands not ’tis his doom he hears:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beholds the meal between his temples cast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The fruit and product of his labours past;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the water views perhaps the knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uplifted to deprive him of his life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then broken up alive, his entrails sees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Torn out, for priests to inspect the gods’ decrees.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘From whence, oh mortal men, this gust of blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have you derived, and interdicted food?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be taught by me this dire delight to shun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Warn’d by my precepts, by my practice won:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when you eat the well-deserving beast,</span>

					<span>For I will sing of mighty mysteries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of truths conceal’d before, from human eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark oracles unveil, and open all the skies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pleased as I am to walk along the sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of shining stars, and travel with the year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To leave the heavy earth, and scale the height</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Atlas, who supports the heavenly weight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To look from upper light, and thence survey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mistaken mortals wandering from the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wanting wisdom, fearful for the state</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of future things, and trembling at their fate!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Those I would teach; and by right reason bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To think of death as but an idle thing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why thus affrighted at an empty name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dream of darkness, and fictitious flame?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vain themes of wit, which but in poems pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fables of a world that never was?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What feels the body when the soul expires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By time corrupted, or consumed by fires?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor dies the spirit, but new life repeats</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In other forms, and only changes seats.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Ev’n I, who these mysterious truths declare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was once Euphorbus in the Trojan war;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My name and lineage I remember well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how in fight by Sparta’s king I fell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Argive Juno’s fame I late beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My buckler hung on high, and own’d my former shield.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Then death, so call’d, is but old matter dress’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In some new figure, and a varied vest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus all things are but alter’d, nothing dies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here and there the unbodied spirit flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By time, or force, or sickness dispossess’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lodges, where it lights, in man or beast;</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>This face assumes, and that impression leaves;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now call’d by one, now by another name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The form is only changed, the wax is still the same.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So death, so call’d, can but the form deface;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The immortal soul flies out in empty space,</span>

					<span>To seek her fortune in some other place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Then let not piety be put to flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To please the taste of glutton appetite;</span>

					<span>With rabid hunger feed upon your kind,</span>

					<span>“ ‘And since, like Typhis parting from the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In ample seas I sail, and depths untried before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This let me farther add, that nature knows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No steadfast station, but or ebbs or flows:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ever in motion; she destroys her old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And casts new figures in another mould.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ev’n times are in perpetual flux, and run,</span>

					<span>Thus in successive course the minutes run,</span>

					<span>And urge their predecessor minutes on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still moving, ever new: for former things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are set aside, like abdicated kings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every moment alters what is done,</span>

					<p epub:type="bridgehead">Hippolytus, rejecting with horror the advances of his stepmother Phaedra, is accused by her of the guilt which he has refused to contract⁠—The angry Theseus entreats Neptune to punish the incontinence of his son, and the innocent youth is thrown from his chariot and dashed to pieces⁠—He is after ward restored to life by Diana, who disguises his features, and bestows on him immortal existence.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Advanced in years he died; one common date</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His reign concluded, and his mortal state.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their tears plebeians and patricians shed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pious matrons wept their monarch dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mournful wife, her sorrows to bewail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withdrew from Rome, and sought the Arician vale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hid in thick woods, she made incessant moans,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disturbing Cynthia’s sacred rites with groans.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How oft the nymphs, who ruled the wood and lake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reproved her tears, and words of comfort spake!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How oft in vain,” the son of Theseus said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thy stormy sorrows be with patience laid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor are thy fortunes to be wept alone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weigh others’ woes, and learn to bear thine own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be mine an instance to assuage thy grief:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would mine were none! yet mine may bring relief.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“You’ve heard, perhaps, in conversation told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What once befell Hippolytus of old;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To death by Theseus’ easy faith betray’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And caught in snares his wicked stepdame laid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wondrous tale your credit scarce may claim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet, strange to say, behold in me the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom amorous Phaedra oft had press’d in vain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My father’s honour and my own to stain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till, seized with fear, or by revenge inspired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She charged on me the crimes herself desired.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Expell’d by Theseus, from his home I fled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With heaps of curses on my guiltless head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forlorn, I sought Pitthean Troezen’s land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drove my chariot o’er Corinthus’ strand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from the surface of the level main</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A billow rising, heaved above the plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rolling and gathering, till so high it swell’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mountain’s height the enormous mass excell’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then bellowing, burst, when from the summit cleaved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A horned bull his ample chest upheaved:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mouth and nostrils storms of briny rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Expiring, blew. Dread horror seized my train.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood unmoved. My father’s cruel doom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Claim’d all my soul, nor fear could find a room.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amazed, a while my trembling coursers stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With prick’d-up ears, contemplating the flood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, starting sudden from the dreadful view,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At once like lightning from the seas they flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And o’er the craggy rocks the chariot drew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain to stop the hot-mouthed steeds I tried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, bending backward, all my strength applied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The frothy foam in driving flakes distains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bits and bridles, and bedews the reins.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But though as yet untamed they run, at length</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their heady rage had tired beneath my strength,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When in the spokes a stump entangling, tore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shatter’d wheel, and from its axle bore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shock impetuous toss’d me from the seat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caught in the reins, beneath my horses’ feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then stretch’d, the well-knit limbs in pieces haled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Part stuck behind, and part the chariot trail’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till, midst my cracking joints and breaking bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I breathed away my wearied soul in groans.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No part distinguish’d from the rest was found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all my parts a universal wound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now say, self-tortured nymph, can you compare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our griefs as equal, or in justice dare?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw besides the darksome realms of wo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bathed my wounds in smoking streams below.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There I had stay’d, nor second life enjoy’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Paean’s son his wondrous art employ’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To light restored, by medicinal skill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In spite of fate, and rigid Pluto’s will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The invidious object to preserve from view,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A misty cloud around me Cynthia threw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lest my sight should stir my foes to rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She stamp’d my visage with the marks of age.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My former hue was changed, and for it shown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A set of features and a face unknown.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A while the goddess stood in doubt, or Crete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Delos’ isle, to choose for my retreat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delos and Crete refused, this wood she chose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bade me my former luckless name depose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which kept alive the memory of my woes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said, ‘Immortal life be thine, and thou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hippolytus once call’d, be Virbius now.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here then a god, but of the inferior race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I serve my goddess, and attend her chase.”</span>

					<p epub:type="bridgehead">A noble Roman, named Cippus, while returning victorious to the city, finds horns growing on his forehead, which are pronounced by the soothsayers to foretell his future reign if he should enter Rome⁠—Unwilling to enslave his country, he voluntarily banishes himself; and a large portion of land without the city walls is allotted for his support by the grateful senate.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Or as when Cippus in the current view’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shooting horns that on his forehead stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His temples first he feels, and, with surprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His touch confirms the assurance of his eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight to the skies his horned front he rears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the gods directs these pious prayers:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“If this portent be prosperous, oh decree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Rome the event; if otherwise, to me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An altar then of turf he hastes to raise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rich gums in fragrant exhalations blaze;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The panting entrails crackle as they fry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And boding fumes pronounce a mystery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the augur saw the holy fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And victims with presaging signs expire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Cippus then he turns his eyes with speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And views the horny honours of his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then cried, “Hail, conqueror! thy call obey;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those omens I behold presage thy sway:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rome waits thy nod, unwilling to be free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And owns thy sovereign power as fate’s decree.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He said; and Cippus, starting at the event,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spoke in these words his pious discontent:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Far hence, ye gods, this execration send,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the great race of Romulus defend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better that I in exile live abhorr’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than e’er the capitol should style me lord.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This spoke, he hides with leaves his omen’d head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then prays; the senate next convenes, and said:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“If augurs can foresee, a wretch is come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Design’d by destiny the bane of Rome.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two horns (most strange to tell) his temples crown:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If e’er he pass the walls, and gain the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your laws are forfeit that ill-fated hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And liberty must yield to lawless power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your gates he might have enter’d; but this arm</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seized the usurper, and withheld the harm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Haste, find the monster out, and let him be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Condemn’d to all the senate can decree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or tied in chains, or into exile thrown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or by the tyrant’s death prevent your own.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The crowd such murmurs utter as they stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As swelling surges breaking on the strand:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or as when gathering gales sweep o’er the grove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And their tall heads the bending cedars move.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each with confusion gazed, and then began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To feel his fellow’s brows, and find the man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cippus then shakes his garland off, and cries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The wretch you want I offer to your eyes.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The anxious throng look’d down, and, sad in thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All wish’d they had not found the sign they sought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In haste, with laurel wreaths his head they bind:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such honour to such virtue was assign’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then thus the senate: “Hear, oh Cippus, hear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So godlike is thy tutelary care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That since in Rome thyself forbids thy stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thy abode those acres we convey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ploughshare can surround, the labour of a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In deathless records thou shalt stand enroll’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Rome’s rich posts shall shine with horns of gold.”</span>

					<span>Melodious maids of Pindus, who inspire</span>

					<span>Say, whence the isle which Tiber flows around,</span>

					<span>Its altars with a heavenly stranger graced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in our shrines the god of physic placed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A wasting plague infected Latium’s skies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pale, bloodless looks were seen, with ghastly eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dire disease’s marks each visage wore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the pure blood was changed to putrid gore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain were human remedies applied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain the power of healing herbs was tried:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wearied with death, they seek celestial aid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And visit Phoebus in his Delphic shade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the world’s centre sacred Delphos stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gives its oracles to distant lands:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here they implore the god, with fervent vows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His salutary power to interpose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And end a great afflicted city’s woes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The holy temple sudden tremours proved;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The laurel grove and all its quivers moved;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hollow sounds the priestess thus began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through each bosom thrilling horrors ran:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The assistance, Roman, which you here implore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seek from another, and a nearer shore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Relief must be implored, and succour won,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not from Apollo, but Apollo’s son;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My son, to Latium borne, shall bring redress;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go with good omens, and expect success.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When these clear oracles the senate knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sacred tripod’s counsels they pursue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Depute a pious and a chosen band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who sail to Epidaurus’ neighbouring land.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the Grecian elders when they stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They pray them to bestow the healing god:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ordain’d was he to save Ausonia’s state;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So promised Delphos, and unerring fate.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Opinions various their debates enlarge:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some plead to yield to Rome the sacred charge;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Others, tenacious of their country’s wealth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Refuse to grant the power who guards its health.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While dubious they remain’d, the wasting light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withdrew before the growing shades of night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thick darkness now obscured the dusky skies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, Roman, closed in sleep were mortal eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When health’s auspicious god appears to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy glad dreams his form celestial see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his left hand, a rural staff preferr’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His right is seen to stroke his decent beard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dismiss,” said he, with mildness all divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dismiss your fears; I come, and leave my shrine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This serpent view, that with ambitious play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My staff encircles, mark him every way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His form, though larger, nobler, I’ll assume,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And changed, as gods should be, bring aid to Rome.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here fled the vision, and the vision’s flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was follow’d by the cheerful dawn of light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nor was the morn with blushing streaks o’erspread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the starry fires of heaven were fled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chiefs perplex’d, and fill’d with doubtful care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To their protector’s sumptuous roofs repair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By genuine signs implore him to express,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What seats he deigns to choose, what land to bless:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scarce their ascending prayers had reached the sky;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, the serpentine god, erected high!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forerunning hissings his approach confess’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bright shone his golden scales, and waved his lofty crest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The trembling altar his appearance spoke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The marble floor, and glittering ceiling shook;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The doors were rock’d; the statue seemed to nod;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the fabric own’d the present god;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His radiant chest he taught aloft to rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round the temple cast his flaming eyes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Struck was the astonish’d crowd; the holy priest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His temples with white bands of ribboned dress’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With reverent awe the power divine confess’d!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The god! the god!” he cries; “all tongues be still!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each conscious breast devoutest ardour fill!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh beauteous! oh divine! assist our cares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be propitious to thy vot’ries prayers!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All with consenting hearts, and pious fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The words repeat, the deity revere:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Romans in their holy worship join’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With silent awe, and purity of mind:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gracious to them, his crest is seen to nod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as an earnest of his care, the god,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thrice hissing, vibrates thrice his forked tongue;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now the smooth descent he glides along:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still on the ancient seats he bends his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which his statue breathes, his altars rise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His long-loved shrine with kind concern he leases,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to forsake the accustom’d mansion grieves:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At length his weeping bulk in state is borne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the throng’d streets, which scatter’d flowers adorn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through many a fold he winds his mazy course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gains the port and moles, which break the ocean’s force.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas here he made a stand, and having view’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pious train, who his last steps pursued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seem’d to dismiss their zeal with gracious eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While gleams of pleasure in his aspect rise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now the Latian vessel he ascends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath the weighty god the vessel bends:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Latins on the strand great Jove appease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their cables loose, and plough the yielding seas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The high-rear’d serpent from the stern displays</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His gorgeous form, and the blue deep surveys;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ship is wafted on with gentle gales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And o’er the calm Ionian smoothly sails;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the sixth morn the Italian coast they gain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And touch Lacinia, graced with Juno’s fane;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now fair Calabria to the sight is lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the cities on her fruitful coast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They pass at length the rough Sicilian shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Brutian soil, rich with metallic ore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The famous isles, where Aeolus was king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Paestus blooming with eternal spring:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Minerva’s cape they leave, and Capreae’s isle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Campania, on whose hills the vineyards smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The city, which Alcides’ spoils adorn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Naples, for soft delight and pleasure born;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fair Stabiae, with Cumean sibyls’ seats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Baiae’s tepid baths, and green retreats;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Linternum next they reach, where balmy gums</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distil from mastic trees, and spread perfumes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cajeta, from the nurse so named for whom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With pious care Aeneas raised a tomb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vulturne, whose whirlpools suck the numerous sands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Trachas, and Minturnae’s marshy lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Formia’s coast is left, and Circe’s plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which yet remembers her enchanting reign;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Antium, last, his course the pilot guides.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here, while the anchor’d vessel safely rides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For now the ruffled deep portends a storm,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spiry god unfolds his spheric form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through large indentings draws his lubric train,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And seeks the refuge of Apollo’s fane;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fane is situate on the yellow shore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the sea smiled, and the winds raged no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He leaves his father’s hospitable lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And furrows, with his rattling scales, the sands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the coast; at length the ship regains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sails to Tibur, and Lavinium’s plains.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here mingling crowds to meet their patron came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ev’n the chaste guardians of the Vestal flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From every part tumultuous they repair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And joyful acclamations rend the air:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the flow’ry banks, on either side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the tall ship floats on the swelling tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disposed in decent order altars rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crackling incense, as it mounts the skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The air with sweets refreshes; while the knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Warm with the victim’s blood, lets out the streaming life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The world’s great mistress, Rome, receives him now;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the mast’s top reclined he waves his brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from that height surveys the great abodes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mansions, worthy of residing gods.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The land, a narrow neck, itself extends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round which his course the stream divided bends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stream’s two arms, on either side, are seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stretch’d out in equal length; the land between.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The isle, so call’d, from hence derives its name:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas here the salutary serpent came;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor sooner has he left the Latian pine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he assumes again his form divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now no more the drooping city mourns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joy is again restored, and health returns.</span>

					<h3 epub:type="title">Deification of Julius Caesar</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">Venus, unable to arrest the impending death of Julius Cesar, procures his admission into the celestial mansions.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>But Esculapius was a foreign power:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his own city Caesar we adore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him arms and arts alike renown’d beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In peace conspicuous, dreadful in the field;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His rapid conquests, and swift-finish’d wars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hero justly fix’d among the stars;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet is his progeny his greatest fame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The son immortal makes the father’s name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea-girt Britons, by his courage tamed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For their high rocky cliffs, and fierceness famed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His dreadful navies, which victorious rode</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er Nile’s affrighted waves and seven-sourced flood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Numidia, and the spacious realms regain’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where Cinyphis or flows, or Juba reign’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The powers of titled Mithridates broke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Pontus added to the Roman yoke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Triumphal shows decreed, for conquests won,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For conquests, which the triumphs still outshone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These are great deeds; yet less, than to have given</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world a lord, in whom, propitious Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When you decreed the sovereign rule to place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You bless’d with lavish bounty human race.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now lest so great a prince might seem to rise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of mortal stem, his sire must reach the skies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beauteous goddess, that Aeneas bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Foresaw it, and foreseeing did deplore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well she knew her hero’s fate was nigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Devoted by conspiring arms to die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trembling, and pale, Jo every god she cried:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Behold, what deep and subtle arts are tried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To end the last, the only branch that springs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From my lulus, and the Dardan kings!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How bent they are! how desperate to destroy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that is left me of unhappy Troy!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Am I alone by fate ordain’d to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uninterrupted care and endless wo?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now from Tydides’ spear I feel the wound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Ilium’s towers the hostile flames surround:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Troy laid in dust, my exiled son I mourn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through angry seas, and raging billows borne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the wide deep his wandering course he bends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now to the sullen shades of Styx descends:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Turnus driven at last fierce wars to wage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether with unpitying Juno’s rage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But why record I now my ancient woes?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sense of past ills in present fears I lose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On me their points the impious daggers throw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forbid it, gods, repel the direful blow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If by cursed weapons Numa’s priest expires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No longer shall ye burn, ye Vestal fires.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While such complainings Cypria’s grief disclose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In each celestial breast compassion rose:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not gods can alter fate’s resistless will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet they foretold by signs the approaching ill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dreadful were heard, among the clouds, alarms</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of echoing trumpets, and of clashing arms;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sun’s pale image gave so faint a light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the sad earth was almost veil’d in night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ether’s face with fiery meteors glow’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With storms of hail were mingled drops of blood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dusky hue the morning star o’erspread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the moon’s orb was stain’d with spots of red;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every place portentous shrieks were heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fatal warnings of the infernal bird;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every place the marble melts to tears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While in the groves, revered through length of years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Boding and awful sounds the ear invade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And solemn music warbles through the shade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No victim can atone the impious age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sacrifice the wrathful gods assuage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dire wars and civil fury threat the state;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every omen points out Caesar’s fate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around each hallow’d shrine, and sacred dome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Night-howling dogs disturb the peaceful gloom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their silent seats the wandering shades forsake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fearful tremblings the rock’d city shake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet could not, by these prodigies, be broke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The plotted charm, or stay’d the fatal stroke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their swords the assassins in the temple draw:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their murdering hands nor gods nor temples awe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sacred place their bloody weapons stain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And virtue falls, before the altar slain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas now fair Cypria, with her woes oppress’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In raging anguish smote her heavenly breast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wild with distracting fears, the goddess tried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her hero in the ethereal cloud to hide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cloud, which youthful Paris did conceal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Menelaus urged the threat’ning steel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cloud, which once deceived Tydides’ sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saved Aeneas in the unequal fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When Jove: “In vain, fair daughter, you essay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To o’errule destiny’s unconquer’d sway:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your doubts to banish, enter fate’s abode;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A privilege to heavenly powers allow’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There you shall see the records graved, in length,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On iron and solid brass, with mighty strength;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which heaven and earth’s concussion shall endure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maugre all shocks, eternal, and secure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, on perennial adamant design’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The various fortunes of your race you’ll find:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well I have mark’d them, and will now relate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thee the settled laws of future fate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He, goddess, for whose death the fates you blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has finish’d his determined course with fame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thee ’tis given at length, that he shall shine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the gods, and grace the worshipp’d shrine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His son to all his greatness shall be heir,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worthily succeed to empire’s care:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ourself will lead his wars, resolved to aid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brave avenger of his father’s shade:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him its freedom Mutina shall owe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Decius his auspicious conduct know;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His dreadful powers shall shake Pharsalia’s plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drench in gore Phillippi’s fields again:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mighty leader, in Sicilia’s flood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great Pompey’s warlike son, shall be subdued;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Egypt’s soft queen, adorn’d with fatal charms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall mourn her soldiers’ unsuccessful arms:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too late shall find her swelling hopes were vain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And know that Rome o’er Memphis still must reign:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What name I Afric, or Nile’s hidden head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as both oceans roll, his power shall spread:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the known earth to him shall homage pay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the seas own his universal sway:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When cruel war no more disturbs mankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To civil studies shall he bend his mind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With equal justice guardian laws ordain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by his great example vice restrain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where will his bounty or his goodness end?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To times unborn his generous views extend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The virtues of his heir our praise engage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And promise blessings to the coming age:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Late shall he in his kindred orbs be placed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Pylian years, and crowded honours graced.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meantime, your hero’s fleeting spirit bear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fresh from his wounds, and change it to a star:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So shall great Julius rites divine assume,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the skies eternal smile on Rome.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This spoke, the goddess to the senate flew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where, her fair form conceal’d from mortal view,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her Caesar’s heavenly part she made her care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor left the recent soul to waste to air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But bore it upward to its native skies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glowing with newborn fires she saw it rise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth springing from her bosom up it flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, kindling as it soar’d, a comet grew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above the lunar sphere it took its flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shot behind it a long trail of light.</span>
